 Scope:

- The main audience for the application will be people suffering from disabling hearing loss.
- The app can also be used in situations like nowadays, some people hear music in earbuds/headphones whole day, which makes them unable to hear the surroundings 

Features:

- The software should give immediate response to user about the sound activity and the source of that activity.
- It should be real time with low latency.

Non-functional requirements:

- The user sholud be able to turn off the alerts when there is no need for them.
- The software should be open for new sound inputs so it can be more extensive and can grow according to the user.
  -> It sholud ask the user in free time for the identity of recorded voices and their importance.
